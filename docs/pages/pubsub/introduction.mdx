# Introduction

PubSub enables you to subscribe to a topic, for updates (e.g. when a user cheers in a channel).

The Twitch PubSub system allows back-end services to broadcast realtime messages to clients. Example applications include:

- An instant messaging service sending instant messages between friends.
- A back-end video system pushing real-time viewer count updates to video players.
- A presence system broadcasting users's online status to all their friends.
