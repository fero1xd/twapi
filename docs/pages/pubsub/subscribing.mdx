# Subscribing

There are several topics you can listen on to using the Pubsub system.
To subscribe to any topic, call the `register()` method of the pubsub client with two arguments.
**First** the topic name, and **second** the condition related to that topic

```ts copy
const listener = pubsub.register("chatModeratorActions", {
    channel_id: 1234567,
    user_id: 1234567,
});
```
<Callout type="info">
    If you are using typescript then you will have all the **code suggestions** for the events and their related conditions. **Condition** is simply specifc data required to subscribe to a topic.
