# Auth Revocation

An authorization can be revoked at any time for a number of reasons, such a user disconnecting from an app through https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections.
Topics associated with the authorization will be unlistened to.

The listener provides an revocation event to register a callback function on
```ts copy
const listener = pubsub.register("chatModeratorActions", {
  channel_id: 1234567,
  user_id: 1234567,
});

listener.onRevocation(() => {
    console.log("[-] Auth Revoked")
})
```

<Callout type="warning">
You will no longer receive events if your subscription gets revoked
