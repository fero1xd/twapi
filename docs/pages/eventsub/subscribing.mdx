# Subscribing

Twitch provides a number of events that you can subscribe to to get near real time notifications. For a list of events, see [EventSub Subscription Types](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-subscription-types).

To subscribe call the `register()` method of the eventsub client.

```ts copy filename="src/sub.ts"
const client = new EventSub(ACCESS_TOKEN, CLIENT_ID);

client.register("channelUpdate", {
  broadcaster_user_id: "123456"
});
```

<Callout type="info">
You dont have to subscribe to events inside the `onConnected` listener. We will automatically register all the pending subscriptions after connecting
</Callout>

## Condition
The register function expects 2 arguments, first the `event` to subscribe to, second a condition.
A **condition** is simply sepecific data required to subscribe to this event.

<Callout type="info">
If you are using typescript, you will have full `auto complete` and you will also not be able to enter invalid conditions.
</Callout>
