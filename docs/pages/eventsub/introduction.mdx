# Introduction

EventSub subscriptions let your application listen for events that happen on Twitch. When an event occurs for one of your subscriptions, Twitch sends you a notification. For example, you can receive a notification when:

- A broadcaster goes online
- A broadcaster gets a new follower
- A broadcaster gets a new subscriber
- A user cheered in a channel
- A user redeemed Channel Points

Twitch support the following transport methods:

- Webhook
- WebSocket

<Callout type="info">
We use **WebSocket** as an only transport right now!
