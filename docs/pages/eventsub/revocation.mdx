# About Revocation
A revocation message is sent if Twitch revokes a subscription. You will also receive the reason for this revocation.


Possible values for reason are:

- `user_removed` - The user mentioned in the subscription no longer exists.

- `authorization_revoked` - The user revoked the authorization token that the subscription relied on.

- `version_removed` - The subscribed to subscription type and version is no longer supported.


## Handling Revocation

We provide a callback function to be registered that will then be called if the subscription gets revoked.

```ts copy filename="src/demo.ts"
const listener = client.register("channelUpdate", {
  broadcaster_user_id: "123456",
});

listener.onRevocation((reason) => {
  console.log('[-] Authorization revoked, reason: ' + reason)
})
```
